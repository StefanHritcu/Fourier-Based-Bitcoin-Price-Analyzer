# 📊 Fourier-Based Bitcoin Price Analyzer

Welcome to the **Fourier-Based Bitcoin Price Analyzer**! 🚀  
This project leverages the **Fourier Transform** to analyze the price fluctuations of Bitcoin over a period of at least one day. Using data from the **Bitcoin API**, it identifies recurring patterns and trends in the data, offering insights into market behaviors, periodic movements, and anomalies. 🧑‍💻

## ⚙️ **How It Works:**

1. **Fourier Transform**:
   - The **Fourier Transform** is a mathematical tool that converts time-domain data (e.g., Bitcoin price over time) into frequency-domain data, revealing patterns and periodic trends that are not immediately apparent in raw data. 🧠
   
2. **Data Input**:
   - The project makes API calls to gather **Bitcoin price data** from sources like **CoinGecko** or **CoinMarketCap**.
   - Data is collected for at least one day to ensure a clear analysis of the price trends.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The Fourier Transform analyzes price data for **repeated trends** or **anomalies** that can influence trading decisions. By understanding the frequency components of the data, we can detect **patterns** that might not be visible in the raw time series.

## 🔧 **Prerequisites:**

To get started, ensure you have the following:

- **JavaScript**: The core language of the project. 🖥️
- **Frontend Environment**: This project works in any modern browser. We recommend using **React.js** or **Vanilla JS** for the best results. 🌐
- **API Access**: You'll need API keys to fetch live Bitcoin data from an API provider like **CoinGecko** or **CoinMarketCap**. 🔑
